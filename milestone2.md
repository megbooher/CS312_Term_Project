# TEAM NAME - Milestone 2

## Color Coordinate
- [x] Beside each dropdown, add a radio button so a current color can be selected.  Defaults to the color in the first row. 
- [x] When a cell in the lower table is clicked, it is colored with the selected color.  
- [x] When a drop-down is changed to a new color (assuming it is valid and doesn't revert), all of the cells in the table change from the old color to the new color.  
- [ ] When a cell in the lower table is clicked, its coordinate is added to the right column by the color name.  For example, if cells A1, B2, and C3 are colored "red" then the row with "red" as the selected color will show "A1, B2, C3" in the right cell.  Keep the cells in lexicographic order.  


## Print View
- [ ] Update the print view to support the new color coordinate generation. 
  - [X]  When the form is submitted, the print view behaves as before.  
  - [X]  Additionally, the radio buttons are NOT shown.  
  - [X]  The lower table's cells remain blank (white) and are not colored.
  - [ ]  The right column of the upper table does contain the cell coordinates.

## Manage Colors
- [ ] Instead of the 10 colors given, allow a user to add/edit/delete colors.  Colors are stored in a `colors` table in the database.  Colors have an id, name, and hex value.  These three columns are all unique, no duplicates.
- [ ] Validation changes so that a user has to enter a number of colors equal to or less than the number of color entries in the database instead of using the old hard-coded 10.  The restriction that selections must be unique is still in place.
  - [ ] Note: This will require you to create dynamic CSS styles in a stylesheet, generated by PHP. (Ben makes it seem like this is the only possible way to do this, but given the current setup, it definitely isnâ€™t)
